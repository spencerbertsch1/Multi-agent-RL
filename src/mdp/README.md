# MDP Model Implementation

In this section we will create a framework for the implementation of the Markov Decision Process that 
describes a game i which one player much surround and contain the other.

Unlike the other parts of this project, this is now modeled and solved using model-based reainforcement learning. 

1. Single-agent solution
    - Policy Iteration
    - Value Iteration

2. Multi-agent solution
    - Policy Iteration
    - Value Iteration
